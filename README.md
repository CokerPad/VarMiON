# VarMiON
This is a reproduction of VarMiON[1] for learning. 
In the original [code](https://github.com/dhruvpatel108/VarMiON) provided by the authors, data isn't contained in the repository. So I generate 10000 samples of steady-heat problem with different thermal conductivity and heat source using [FEniCS](https://fenicsproject.org/) to reproduce the results.

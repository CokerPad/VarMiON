# VarMiON
This is a reproduction of VarMiON[1] for learning. 
In the original [code](https://github.com/dhruvpatel108/VarMiON) provided by the authors, data isn't contained in the repository. So I generate 10000 samples of steady-heat problem with different thermal conductivity and heat source using [FEniCS](https://fenicsproject.org/) to reproduce the results.
And you can download datasets through [jianguoyun](https://www.jianguoyun.com/c/sd/1a29efc/39d67d926c514f33#from=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.jianguoyun.com%2Fc%2Fsd%2F1a29efc%2F39d67d926c514f33)
